# 172-project05
This is the final project I did for Principles of Computer Science 2. 
It's a python project using flask to deploy small website which pulls from the PokeAPI to create a couple different quiz games based on pokemon knowledge. 
This project demonstrated my understanding of objects, classes, APIs, and the use of HTML, CSS, and flask to deploy a website using python.
